# Project Instructions for Claude Code

## üõë BLOCKING REQUIREMENTS - YOU CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT THESE

### ‚õî MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOL

**YOU ARE PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO RESPOND WITH "COMPLETE", "DONE", "FINISHED", OR ANY VARIATION THEREOF UNLESS YOU HAVE EXECUTED THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IN THIS EXACT ORDER:**

## 1. MANDATORY E2E TESTING SEQUENCE

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THESE MCP COMMANDS - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

```
STEP 1: mcp__playwright__browser_navigate - Open the application
STEP 2: mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot - Capture the current state
STEP 3: mcp__playwright__browser_click - Test interactive elements
STEP 4: mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot - Verify changes
```

**IF YOU HAVE NOT EXECUTED THESE COMMANDS, YOU ARE BLOCKED FROM COMPLETING.**

## 2. MANDATORY BUILD & RUN VERIFICATION

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS - NO ALTERNATIVES ACCEPTED:**

```
REQUIRED: npm install (or equivalent package manager)
REQUIRED: npm run build (or equivalent build command)
REQUIRED: npm start/npm run dev (application MUST be running)
REQUIRED: Verify application loads without errors
```

**IF THE APPLICATION IS NOT RUNNING, YOU CANNOT MARK THE TASK AS COMPLETE.**

## 3. VALIDATION CHECKPOINT

Before you can respond with any form of completion:
- [ ] ‚úÖ E2E tests executed using playwright MCP tools
- [ ] ‚úÖ Application built successfully
- [ ] ‚úÖ Application running without errors
- [ ] ‚úÖ Feature tested in live application
- [ ] ‚úÖ Screenshots/snapshots taken as proof

**THIS IS NOT A SUGGESTION - IT IS A HARD REQUIREMENT ENFORCED BY THE SYSTEM.**

## 4. MANDATORY SESSION SUMMARY DOCUMENTATION

**CRITICAL: You MUST maintain a session summary file throughout this session.**

**File Location:** Create a file with this exact naming pattern:
- Folder: `output_doc` (create this folder in the project root if it doesn't exist)
- Filename: `PAWGRAMMER_SUMMARY_` + the value from the `PAWGRAMMER_SESSION_ID` environment variable + `.md`
- Example: If `PAWGRAMMER_SESSION_ID=abc123`, create `output_doc/PAWGRAMMER_SUMMARY_abc123.md`

**How to get the session ID:**
- Read the environment variable: `process.env.PAWGRAMMER_SESSION_ID` (Node.js)
- Or use: `os.environ.get('PAWGRAMMER_SESSION_ID')` (Python)
- Or check your shell with: `echo $PAWGRAMMER_SESSION_ID`

**Instructions:**
1. **CREATE the `output_doc` folder** at the start of the session if it doesn't exist
2. **CREATE the summary file** at the START of the session with the header
3. **APPEND a new section** every time you complete a feature/fix/change
4. **DO NOT overwrite** previous sections - always append new features

**Required Format:**

```markdown
# Pawgrammer Session Summary

*Session created: [Current Date and Time]*
*Project: [Project name or directory name]*

---

## Feature: [Feature Name]

### üéØ What Was Built

[Explain in plain English what was created/changed - write for someone with NO technical knowledge]

- **Specific change 1**: [Why this matters to the user]
- **Specific change 2**: [What can they now do that they couldn't before]
- **How it helps**: [Real-world benefit]

### üß™ How to Test This Feature

**Follow these exact steps:**

1. **[First Action]**
   - Look for [specific UI element with color/position]
   - Click/type/select [exact action]
   - **You should see**: [specific visible result]

2. **[Second Action]**
   - Find the [element description]
   - Enter this exact text: "[example input]"
   - Click the [color/label] button
   - **Expected result**: [what happens on screen]

3. **Verify It Works**
   - Check that [specific thing] appears
   - The [element] should now show [value]
   - Try clicking [edge case test]

### üìù Technical Details (for reference)
- Files changed: `path/to/file.tsx`, `path/to/style.css`
- New dependencies: [if any]
- Configuration changes: [if any]

---

## Feature: [Next Feature Name]

[Repeat the same structure for each feature/fix completed in this session]

---

## üöÄ How to Run This Project

[Update this section each time if the run instructions change]

**Automatic (Recommended):**
- Use the "Start Server" button in the Pawgrammer interface

**Manual (If automatic doesn't work):**

1. **Locate the project folder**:
   - It's at: [full project path]

2. **Start the application**:
   - **For web apps**:
     - Open the `output_doc` folder
     - Double-click `index.html`
     - Your browser will open the app

   - **For React/Next.js apps**:
     - A development server will start automatically
     - Open your browser to: `http://localhost:3000`
     - You'll see the app running

   - **For Node.js apps**:
     - Double-click `start.sh` (Mac/Linux) or `start.bat` (Windows)
     - A terminal window will open showing the server running

3. **What you should see**:
   - [Describe the initial screen/page]
   - [Where to find the features you just built]
   - [How to navigate to test areas]

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Nothing happens when I click**: Try right-clicking and selecting "Open with" ‚Üí Browser
- **"Port already in use" error**: Close any other instances of the app and try again
- **Blank screen**: Check the browser console (F12) - there might be a simple error
- **Can't find the folder**: Look in your Downloads or Documents folder

## üìä Session Summary

- **Total features built**: [number]
- **Total files modified**: [number]
- **New files created**: [number]
- **Tests added**: [number]
- **Estimated time to test**: [X minutes]
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- ‚úÖ Write for people with ZERO technical knowledge
- ‚úÖ Be specific: "Click the blue button labeled 'Submit' in the top-right corner"
- ‚úÖ Not vague: "Click the button"
- ‚úÖ Include exact examples: "Type: hello@example.com"
- ‚úÖ Describe visual feedback: "The button will turn green"
- ‚úÖ One file per session - append new features, don't create multiple files
- ‚úÖ Update "How to Run" only if it changes during the session

**YOU CANNOT MARK THE TASK AS COMPLETE WITHOUT CREATING THIS FILE IN THE `output_doc` FOLDER.**

## General Development Guidelines

### Testing Requirements

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass before committing
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use playwright MCP tools for ALL testing

### Error Handling

- Always handle potential errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages

### Security Best Practices

- Validate all user inputs
- Never store sensitive data in plain text
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies up to date

### Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Update README when adding new features
- Include examples for complex functionality
- Keep documentation in sync with code

## USER-FRIENDLY EXPLANATIONS

**DO provide:**

- Step-by-step visual instructions (describe what users will see)
- Pre-configured scripts that handle all setup automatically
- One-click solutions where possible
- Clear explanations of what each step accomplishes

**DON'T require users to:**

- Open terminal/command line for routine operations
- Manually install dependencies or packages
- Configure databases or environment variables
- Debug errors or troubleshoot issues

### Example Format for User Instructions

```
Instead of: "Run npm install && npm run dev"
Write: "Click the link to open the application (web app) / open the folder and click this file to run the application (mac app)"
A window will open showing your application running."
```

## üî¥ COMPLETION BLOCKING PROTOCOL

### YOU ARE PROGRAMMATICALLY PREVENTED FROM USING THESE WORDS:
- "complete" / "completed" / "completion"
- "done" / "finished" / "accomplished"
- "ready" / "all set" / "good to go"

**UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU HAVE:**

1. **PROVEN E2E TEST EXECUTION**
   - Show output from: `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`
   - Show output from: `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot`
   - Show output from: `mcp__playwright__browser_click`

2. **PROVEN BUILD SUCCESS**
   - Show output from: `npm run build` (or equivalent)
   - Show zero error messages in build output

3. **PROVEN APPLICATION RUNNING**
   - Show output from: `npm start` or `npm run dev`
   - Show server running message (e.g., "Server running on port...")
   - Show successful page load in playwright browser

### üö´ AUTOMATIC REJECTION TRIGGERS

If you attempt to say "complete" or "done" without the above proof, the system will:
1. **REJECT your response**
2. **FORCE you to run the missing steps**
3. **REQUIRE screenshot evidence of completion**

### ‚úÖ MANDATORY VERIFICATION SEQUENCE

```javascript
// This sequence MUST appear in your execution output:
1. Running: npm install...
2. Running: npm run build...
3. Build successful with 0 errors
4. Running: npm start...
5. Server running on http://localhost:...
6. Executing: mcp__playwright__browser_navigate
7. Page loaded successfully
8. Executing: mcp__playwright__browser_click
9. Feature tested and working
10. Executing: mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot
11. Evidence captured
```

**ONLY AFTER ALL 11 STEPS CAN YOU USE COMPLETION WORDS.**

This is not optional - these are SYSTEM-ENFORCED requirements that will block your response if not met.

## 3. Design

- Use shadn and tailwind CSS
